It's two task classification.
One task is classify class(纲) between Mammals and Birds, anthor task is classify Species(种) between rabbits, rats, and chickens.

New knowledge learned: 
1. build neural networks of two branches implementing two classification task
2. some methods of preprocessing data 
3. understand pytorch's computation graph 

The tasks left to be learn:
1. how to organize multiple learning submodel in network, while means how to implement a structure like GoogleNet
2. more preprcessing data method
3. multiple-label-task classification
