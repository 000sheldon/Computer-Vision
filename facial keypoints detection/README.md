Project Description: It's a kaggle project named Facial keypoints detections, the objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images.  website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

Framework: Tensorflow

New knowledge learnedï¼š
Facial keypoints detection is likely to classifiction, which last layer doesn't need activation function. Each output neurons corresponds to a keypoints coordinates(x_coordinate or y_coordinate)

New knowledge left to learn:
How to precisely control tensor forward flow and gradient backpropagation like pytorch.
I am familiar with numpy but not familiar with pandas, so I should learn more about pandas
